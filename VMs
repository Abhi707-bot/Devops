Let’s combine the notes from the images and your previous input into a comprehensive set of notes for your DevOps interview preparation. The images focus on SSH (password-based and key-based authentication) and related concepts, while your earlier input covered domains, IPs, VMs, and hosting. I’ll organize everything into clear sections for easy reference.

### DevOps Interview Prep Notes: Domains, IPs, VMs, SSH, and Hosting

#### 1. Domains vs. IPs
- **IP Address**:
  - A unique numerical identifier for a device on a network (e.g., `192.168.1.1` for IPv4, `::1` for IPv6).
  - Essential for routing data across networks like the internet.
  - Not human-friendly; hard to memorize.
- **Domain Name**:
  - A human-readable name (e.g., `google.com`) mapped to an IP via DNS (Domain Name System).
  - Example: `ping google.com` resolves to an IP like `142.250.190.14`.
- **Localhost**:
  - Refers to the current machine you’re working on.
  - Loopback address: `127.0.0.1` (IPv4) or `::1` (IPv6).
  - Used for testing network communication on the same device.
  - Example: `ping localhost` pings `127.0.0.1`.
- **Interview Tip**:
  - “An IP is a device’s address on a network, like 127.0.0.1 for localhost. A domain like google.com resolves to an IP via DNS for user convenience.”

#### 2. Networking Basics
- **Local Network (Intranet)**:
  - Devices on the same Wi-Fi/router communicate via private IPs (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).
  - Example: Access a Node.js app on one laptop from another using its private IP (e.g., `192.168.1.10:3000`).
- **Routing**:
  - Routers assign private IPs within a local network and translate them to public IPs for the internet (NAT - Network Address Translation).
- **Mild Hosting (Local Deployment)**:
  - Steps:
    1. Start an app (e.g., Node.js) on a port (e.g., `3000`).
    2. Find your machine’s private IP (e.g., `ipconfig` on Windows, `ifconfig` or `ip addr` on Linux).
    3. Access it from another device on the same network (e.g., `192.168.1.10:3000`).
- **Interview Tip**:
  - “On a local network, I’d start a Node.js app on port 3000, find my IP with `ipconfig`, and access it from another device.”

#### 3. Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **Definition**:
  - A virtual computer running on a physical server, abstracted by a hypervisor.
  - Acts as an independent machine with its own OS and apps.
- **Hypervisor**:
  - Software (e.g., VMware, KVM, Xen) that divides physical resources (CPU, memory, storage) into VMs.
  - Enables logical isolation: VM1 and VM2 don’t share memory/CPU directly.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexibility: Run different OSes on the same hardware.
  - Scalability: Spin up, modify, or delete VMs easily.
  - Efficiency: Consolidate workloads on one server.
- **VMs vs. Bare-Metal**:
  - **Bare-Metal**: OS runs directly on hardware, no hypervisor.
    - Pros: Better performance (direct resource access).
    - Use Case: High-performance apps (databases, gaming servers, crypto mining).
  - **VMs**: Virtualized, share resources via hypervisor.
    - Pros: Isolation, flexibility.
    - Cons: Slight performance overhead.
- **Logical Isolation**:
  - Dividing one server into multiple VMs (e.g., VM1, VM2) using a hypervisor.
  - Each VM operates independently despite sharing hardware.
- **Interview Tip**:
  - “A hypervisor like VMware divides a server into VMs, each acting independently with its own IP and resources.”

#### 4. SSH (Secure Shell)
- **Definition**:
  - SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure communication between two systems, typically for remote administration.
  - Commonly used to log into remote servers, execute commands, and transfer files securely.
- **Key Features of SSH**:
  1. **Encryption**:
     - Encrypts data sent between client and server, making it secure compared to plaintext protocols like Telnet or FTP.
  2. **Authentication**:
     - Two methods:
       - **Password-based**: Enter a password to authenticate (less secure).
       - **Public Key-based**: Uses a private-public key pair for authentication (more secure).
  3. **Integrity**:
     - Ensures data isn’t tampered with during transit; connection is disrupted if tampering is detected.
- **Authentication Methods**:
  - **Password-based** (First Image):
    - Set a password for the `root` user (e.g., on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean).
    - Requirements: At least 8 characters, 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, cannot end with a special character.
    - Command to connect: `ssh root@SERVER_IP`.
    - **Security Note**: Store the password securely; it won’t be emailed.
  - **Public Key-based** (Second Image):
    - Generate a key pair using `ssh-keygen`.
    - Default location: `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (private key) and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (public key).
    - View keys: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (public) and `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` (private).
    - Command to connect: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@SERVER_IP`.
    - **Use Case**: Add the public key to GitHub for password-less `git push`.
- **Basic SSH Commands**:
  - Connect: `ssh user@remote-ip` (e.g., `ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.10`).
  - With key: `ssh -i key.pem user@remote-ip`.
  - Copy files: `scp file.txt user@remote-ip:/path`.
  - Default port: 22 (can be changed for security).
- **Practical Example** (Second Image):
  - Generate a key pair: `ssh-keygen`.
  - Add public key to GitHub: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, copy, and paste into GitHub SSH settings.
  - Clone a repo: `git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git`.
  - Connect to a server: `ssh ubuntu@IP`.
- **Interview Tip**:
  - “SSH provides secure remote access. I’d use password-based for quick setups but prefer key-based for security, like adding a public key to GitHub for password-less pushes.”

#### 5. Hosting Options (Actual Deployment)
- **Mild Hosting**:
  - Deploy locally on a network (e.g., Node.js app on `192.168.1.10:3000`).
- **Production Hosting**:
  1. **Renting Servers on Cloud**:
     - Providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
  2. **Renting Compute in Data Centers**:
     - Lease hardware from DigitalOcean, Linode.
  3. **Self-Hosting**:
     - Buy hardware (e.g., CPU rack) and host at home.
     - Manage power, cooling, internet.
  4. **Serverless Providers**:
     - AWS Lambda, Vercel, Netlify.
     - Run code without managing servers; auto-scales.
  5. **Cloud-Native (Kubernetes - k8s)**:
     - Orchestrates containers (e.g., Docker) across servers.
- **Deployment Workflow**:
  1. Write app (e.g., Node.js).
  2. Test locally (localhost or local network).
  3. Deploy to VM/cloud (SSH to server, upload code, run).
  4. Expose via domain (DNS setup) or IP.
- **Interview Tip**:
  - “For production, I’d deploy on a cloud VM, SSH into it, and set up my app. For scalability, I’d use Kubernetes to manage containers.”

#### 6. Interview Scenarios & Answers
- **Explain SSH Authentication**:
  - “SSH supports password-based and key-based authentication. Password-based uses a password for the user, like `root@SERVER_IP`, while key-based uses a private-public key pair. I’d generate a key with `ssh-keygen`, add the public key to the server or GitHub, and connect with `ssh -i key.pem user@ip`.”
- **Describe a Deployment**:
  - “I’d start by testing my app locally on `localhost:3000`. Then, I’d deploy it to a cloud VM by SSHing into the server (`ssh ubuntu@IP`), uploading the code with `scp`, and running it. I’d use a key pair for secure access.”
- **VMs vs. Bare-Metal**:
  - “VMs use a hypervisor for isolation and flexibility but have overhead. Bare-metal runs directly on hardware for better performance, ideal for high-performance apps like databases.”
- **Domains and IPs**:
  - “Domains like google.com resolve to IPs via DNS for user convenience. IPs like 127.0.0.1 (localhost) are used for routing data on networks.”
